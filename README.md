# RL-concept-learning-project
Consolidation of work for the RL concept learning project targeted for AAAI '23.
This work is inspired by the "Simulating Early Word Learning in Situated Connectionist Agents" paper by Deepmind: https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci20/papers/0155/0155.pdf

We use vision-language models to learn various spatial relationships in a simulated RL environment. The environment is generated using Unity 3D and writing of several C# scripts. The Unity ML-Agents package is used to interface between the models and the agent in the Unity environment.
